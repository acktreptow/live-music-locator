# Live Music Locator Video Homepage

I wanted to create a non-scrolling homepage that used video as its background, and live music was the perfect subject matter to gain this experience.

So welcome to Live Music Locator! A fictional company that finds musical artists performing in your area.

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Premiere Pro
- Photoshop

## Project Overview

The non-scrolling homepage uses CSS properties like flexbox and position relative/absolute, pseudo-classes, and JS on the hamburger menu to create the modern UX experience these layouts are known for.

It was a fun task. But it was my second goal - the video background - that made this project particularly rewarding to complete, as I had to utilize my video production skills to bring my vision to the screen.

I wanted a montage of musical artists from different genres, different types of venues, show around 4 seconds for each artist, and have specific video effects depending on the clip.

Obviously, something with these exact specifications doesn't exist, so I edited the video myself using the Premiere Pro skills I developed at an old job as a video producer.

I'm very happy with how it turned out. Especially with the start and end clips that create a natural loop of the sequence when brought into the HTML file.

I also specifically de-saturated the video and wrote the CSS so that the user could add their own color as an overlay to suit their tastes. I personally went for a warmer white balance that gives the background a more natural 'pop', but doesn't make the white text ineligible.

This was a really fun experience that has me looking forward to whenever I can implement video in future projects. Although the applications used are different (I also used Photoshop for the logo), the creative thought process of translating your vision to the screen is very much the same!

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/live-music-locator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd live-music-locator`
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Future Enhancements

There's functionality I could add. For example, creating pages for the li elements in the navbar.

Whilst this would be a nice feature, it's a low priority as the main goal of the project - to create a non-scrollable homepage with a video for a background - was accomplished.

Other projects will therefore take priority.
